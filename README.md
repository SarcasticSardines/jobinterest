+ Create a web app with browser router displaying five jobs you want to work at and diving into why you want to work there and what the job will require and provide.
+ Peer reviewed by: Leo Garcia
+ Review: All job pages follow a simple format that gives brief discussions about the jobs, navbar contrasts well with the text, home page buttons change color when hovering. Not sure what else to say, the pages are brief yet well done for what they are. Also love the Baba on the home page banner, need to download and play that game at some point.
